## Examples of tests to be checked.

push: never changes the source (this directory), except for the log update.
pull: never changes the source (that directory). Maybe updates log there?
sync: doesn't delete files, only appends to SRC and DEST (and what about commits?)
-- it seems I don't need sync. I needed push/pull --new.

log, commit don't change the working directory.
help doesn't change anything.

Seems I don't understand well how commits are managed.

Commits:
-- help to prevent updates from older repositories.
--- In fact it's safe enough, since commits are preserved (but still).
- help to understand which files are not deleted, but moved (via hard links).
- maybe refuse to push/pull without unfinished commits? A flag for that.
-- no, in fact it's useful to pull other data (with --new), then create a commit.
